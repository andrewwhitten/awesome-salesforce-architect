# awesome-salesforce-architect
Inspired by the [awesome-salesforce list](https://github.com/mailtoharshit/awesome-salesforce)

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

I wanted to create something more focused on Salesforce architects rather than tools and frameworks for developers. Architects still need those, and you should definately check out that list.

I really want this list to be as short as possible, with every link below adding some value to your Salesforce Architect journey. If you want to add something then please submit a pull request or even just fork this list for yourself!

### Certifications for Architects
Opinions vary around whether you need to be certified by Salesforce to be an Architect. Some say that only a top certified CTA can speak with authority, and some say they can do their work with no certifications at all. In practice you are going to be helped by archieving some level of certification, as well as learning about platform aspects that you would otherwise not have encountered in your current job:

* [Salesforce Architect Certification Overview](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/credentials/architectoverview) - Everything on Trailhead you need to plan your Architect journey, including CAA (Certified Application Architect), CSA (Certified System Architect) and CTA (Certified Technical Architect)
* [Salesforce Architect Trailmixes (fileter on Trailmixes)](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/search?keywords=architect) - Comprehensive and free online Trailhead lessons to get you ready for your certification exams. Consensus is that these are a great start, but extra study and experience is ussually needed to pass the architect level exams
* [Focus on Force (PAID)](https://focusonforce.com/salesforce-certifications/) - FoF have good study guides and practice exam questions to get you ready for your Certified Application Architect (CAA) exam

As an Architect it is good to keep your finger on the pulse of the industry. There are not too many forums dedicated solely to Architects, but still a lot to learn from other experiences:

* [Salesforce Sub-reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/salesforce/) - completely unofficial, but monitored by Salesforce employees and free of marketing spin
* [Salesforce Developer Sub-reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SalesforceDeveloper/) - less used than the main subreddit, but more appropriate for difficult technical questions
* [SFDX Discord Server](https://sfxd.github.io/) - Long established unofficial developer community
* [Ohana Slack Channel](https://meighanrockssf.com/2019/04/02/salesforce-ohana-slack/) - Long established general community on Salesforce's new Slack aquisition
* [Salesforce Architects on Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/salesforce-architects/) - Not strictly an interactive community, but many Architects are part of this group

### Podcasts
* [Salesforce Developer Podcast](https://developer.salesforce.com/podcast) - Official Salesforce Developer podcast with a good number of Architect relevant episodes. Some epidsodes are also on the YouTube channel listed earlier.
* [Good day sir](https://www.gooddaysirpodcast.com/episodes) - Unofficial Podcast
