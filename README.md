# awesome-salesforce-architect
Inspired by the [awesome-salesforce list](https://github.com/mailtoharshit/awesome-salesforce)

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

I wanted to create something more focused on Salesforce architects rather than tools and frameworks for developers. Architects still need those, and you should definately check out that list.

I really want this list to be as short as possible, with every link below adding some value to your Salesforce Architect journey. If you want to add something then please submit a pull request or even just fork this list for yourself!

### Articles for Architects
* [Salesforce Record Access Under the Hood](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.salesforce_record_access_under_the_hood.meta/salesforce_record_access_under_the_hood/uth_preface.htm) - Important technical description of how Salesforce actually works at its database level, and how that impacts you.

### Resources for Architects

* [Salesforce Major Release Notes](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.salesforce_release_notes.htm) - Salesforce releases a lot of new platform features three times a year. As an architect it is worth to be across them to see what can be part of your org's roadmap


### Certifications for Architects
Opinions vary around whether you need to be certified by Salesforce to be an Architect. Some say that only a top certified CTA can speak with authority, and some say they can do their work with no certifications at all. In practice you are going to be helped by archieving some level of certification, as well as learning about platform aspects that you would otherwise not have encountered in your current job:

* [Salesforce Architect Certification Overview](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/credentials/architectoverview) - Everything on Trailhead you need to plan your Architect journey, including CAA (Certified Application Architect), CSA (Certified System Architect) and CTA (Certified Technical Architect)
* [Salesforce Architect Trailmixes (filter on Trailmixes)](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/search?keywords=architect) - Comprehensive and free online Trailhead lessons to get you ready for your certification exams. Consensus is that these are a great start, but extra study and experience is ussually needed to pass the architect level exams
* [Focus on Force (PAID)](https://focusonforce.com/salesforce-certifications/) - FoF have good study guides and practice exam questions to get you ready for your Certified Application Architect (CAA) exam
* [TOGAF](https://www.opengroup.org/togaf) - the inspiration to Salesforce's new SOGAF framework, and well regarded in its own right. Vendor neutral.

### Blogs

* [YouTube Salesforce Developer](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=UUKORm8sxh3cheBpqs0akkhg) - Official Salesforce videos for developers

### Online Communities
As an Architect it is good to keep your finger on the pulse of the industry. There are not too many forums dedicated solely to Architects, but still a lot to learn from other experiences:

* [Salesforce Sub-reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/salesforce/) - completely unofficial, but monitored by Salesforce employees and free of marketing spin
* [Salesforce Developer Sub-reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SalesforceDeveloper/) - less used than the main subreddit, but more appropriate for difficult technical questions
* [SFDX Discord Server](https://sfxd.github.io/) - Long established unofficial developer community
* [Ohana Slack Channel](https://meighanrockssf.com/2019/04/02/salesforce-ohana-slack/) - Long established general community on Salesforce's new Slack aquisition
* [Salesforce Architects on Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/salesforce-architects/) - Not strictly an interactive community, but many Architects are part of this group
* [Salesforce Architects on Twitter](https://twitter.com/SalesforceArchs) - @SalesforceArchs as above

### Podcasts
* [Salesforce Developer Podcast](https://developer.salesforce.com/podcast) - Official Salesforce Developer podcast with a good number of Architect relevant episodes. Some epidsodes are also on the YouTube channel listed earlier.
* [Good day sir](https://www.gooddaysirpodcast.com/episodes) - Unofficial Podcast

### Tools for Architects
Worth noting that [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com) announced special (paid) Salesforce diagramming tools at Trailheadx '21, but I can't find anything released yet.

* [Free Salesforce Developer Org](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup) - Signup for Free Salesforce Developer environment.
* [diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net) - Usefull online drawing service that allows you to create UML diagrams. Not Salesforce specific at all. You can build basic diagrams for free, however higher complexity diagrams will require a paid subscription

### Related Salesforce Products
Salesforce has been investing heavially in aquisitions that are gradually integrating further into their core product. A Salesforce Architect is likely to meet some of these during their career, and worth understanding:

* [MuleSoft](https://www.mulesoft.com) - core integration platform, and used in plenty of non-Salesforce environments
* [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com) - Analytics platform, and already appearing in the core platform as Tableau CRM (merging into the previous Einstien Analytics product)
* [Slack](https://slack.com) - Collaboration platform, and possibly the future user experience for CRM in the Salesforce stack
* [Marketing Cloud](https://www.salesforce.com/products/marketing-cloud/overview/) - Email marketing platform for advanced customer engagement
* [Salesforce Industries](https://www.salesforce.com/solutions/industries/) - Industry specific accelerators for Salesforce, including advanced configuration based data access and forms functionality. Used to be the Vlocity company.
* [Salesforce App Exchange](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/) - An Architect should know when 'build your own' is going to be costly, and a proven paid product from the market, certified by Salesforce, is going to be a better strategic fit

### Other Vendors
You can't learn everything, but Salesforce seldom exists in isolation. Although keeping everying on one platform is attractive, it is still important to know when to leverage other technology when appropriate:

* [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/featured-partners/salesforce/) - AWS is the 'official' cloud partner to Salesforce, with both companies building connectors between their services
* [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) - Although considered a competitor to Salesforce, the Azure platform is found in many customers and it is completely feasible to integrate services in Salesforce
* [Microsoft Office 365](https://www.office.com/) - Microsoft's other cloud service is also pervasive, and Salesforce also offer connectors to OneDrive, Outlook and Teams
